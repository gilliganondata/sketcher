Quick exploration of the sketcher package: https://htsuda.net/sketcher/


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(sketcher)

# load an image
# img = im_load("images/tim_wilson.jpg")
img = im_load("images/ring-billed-gulls-on-ice.jpg")

```

### The Original Image

```{r original}
plot(img)
```

### Variations of Style and Lineweight

**(Default) Style = 1 | Lineweight = 1**

```{r}
img_sketch_s1_l1 = sketch(img, style = 1, lineweight = 1) 
plot(img_sketch_s1_l1)
```

**Style = 1 | Lineweight = 3**

```{r}
img_sketch_s1_l3 = sketch(img, style = 1, lineweight = 3) 
plot(img_sketch_s1_l3)
```

**Style = 2 | Lineweight = 1**

```{r}
img_sketch_s2_l1 = sketch(img, style = 2, lineweight = 1) 
plot(img_sketch_s2_l1)
```

**Style = 2 | Lineweight = 3**

```{r}
img_sketch_s2_l3 = sketch(img, style = 2, lineweight = 3) 
plot(img_sketch_s2_l3)
```
